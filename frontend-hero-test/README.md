__This test is part of the Netcentric Recruitment process, it should not be shared, distributed or exposed anywhere__

## Installation
* Use node v6.x
* For the first use, run `npm install`. It will install all needed packages and run the build.
* Once the install is done, to recompile, run `npm run build`
* Run a server in the `src/` folder, and open the index.html page to see the project.

=> For more details, head to the [setup file](setup.md).

## Requirements
This project is fully functional and designed, for a mouse user, with no need for assistive technology. However, it is difficult to use it with a keyboard, and almost impossible to follow with assistive technologies.  
Your goal is to improve this page, as much as possible, so that it becomes accessible, following the __WCAG standards__. It must at least conform with the __level AA__.  
As accessibility is a requirement amongst many others in a project, your page should also always validate, when you run the `npm run build`.  


Feel free to modify:  
* Styles
* HTML
* JavaScript  

As long as the functionality of the shopping cart and the general visual identity of the page stay the same.

## When you're done
Once the page is accessible following the WCAG level AA standards, you can add a link to your repository to the Badge's ticket. Give cloning rights to the badge keeper and their deputy!  
Please keep the solution to yourself, just like other badgesÂ´s quizzes or videos.  
To speed up the review process, you can list here, or in a new file, all the improvements you made.
